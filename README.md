# Bike-Purchase-Dashboard-in-MS-Excel
This is Excel Project on Bike Purchase Dataset.
I have performed several steps to build this Bike Purchase Dashboard.
1. Removing Duplicate data.
2. Finding and Replacing short forms in Gender & Marital Status columns to make it easy to understand for everyone.
3. Converting currrencies.
4. Adding a new Age Bracket column to Data set.
5. Modifying Distance Commute column to easy analysis.
6. Creating pivot tables and charts.
7. Creating Dashboard and adding slicers for filtering.

Note:
I have made raw dataset and worked dataset separate and have added separate Dashboard sheet in file.
